WarehouseSystem:
This is a system for handling the selection and loading of fascia for bumpers
on minivans.
It tracks the status of the orders, provides computer support for warehousing
workers, and keeps track of inventory levels in the warehouse.

Command-line Usage:
First, cd into the **project** folder. Make sure that **project/16orders.txt**,
**project/initial.csv**, **project/translation.csv** and
**project/traversal_table.csv** are presented. Otherwise, our code won't run
successfully and will throw IOException.
________________________________________________________________________________
Cd into **src/simulation** and compile the code using the following command:
(We didn't use *.java because there are JUnit test classes in the same
directory)

$javac Loader.java Order.java Pallet.java Picker.java Sequencer.java Loader.java Worker.java Simulation.java Warehouse.java WarehouseSystem.java Request.java WarehousePicking.java

________________________________________________________________________________
Cd into the **project** (i.e. ../../) folder and run the simulation:

$ java -classpath ./src simulation.Simulation 16orders.txt

Then, you should see print statements in command-line logging the events
happening in the system. It will produce project/orders.csv which records
the orders loaded on the truck and project/final.csv recording the racks that
do not have 30 fascia.
